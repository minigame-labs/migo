// Surface-recreate probe: does the main canvas still describe the surface after
// the native surface was destroyed and recreated at a different size?
//
// The size the engine gives a canvas the content never sized is derived from the
// surface, so it has to be re-derived when the surface changes. A same-window
// resize (`migo_surface_update`) is one path and a destroy/recreate (background,
// display resize, fold, rotate-while-away) is the other; only content can see
// whether both arrive at the same answer, because `canvas.width` is the only
// place the decision surfaces.
//
// Deliberately never assigns `canvas.width`. Content that does owns its backing
// store and the engine must NOT resize it; that is the opposite property and a
// probe that set a size could not observe this one.
//
// The verdict is a colour so a screenshot is the evidence, and the numbers are
// drawn next to it so the failure says what it was rather than only that it
// happened. `frames` is the paired liveness reading: a green frame from an
// engine that stopped painting would be indistinguishable from a correct one
// without it.

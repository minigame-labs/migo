//! The OHAudio device backend, for OpenHarmony.
//!
//! OpenHarmony's userspace is musl and has no ALSA, and cpal has no OHAudio support, so
//! this is the one platform that reaches a device without cpal. Only the device half
//! lives here: the ring buffer, the watermarks and the real-time render logic are in the
//! parent module, shared with the cpal backend, so the allocation gates that cover the
//! callback cover this one too.
//!
//! Declared by hand against `<ohaudio/native_audiostreambuilder.h>` and
//! `<ohaudio/native_audiorenderer.h>` rather than generated: it is fourteen functions and
//! six enum constants, and a bindgen step would put a clang and a header search path between
//! this crate and a build that already has to pin both for V8.

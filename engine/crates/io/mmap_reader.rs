//! Memory-mapped file reader for large binary payloads.
//!
//! Callers that would otherwise go through `std::fs::read()` + a
//! `Vec<u8>` heap copy can opt into [`mmap_file_bytes`] when the
//! payload is big enough that the copy itself is a measurable cost
//! (tens of MB at the tail of the distribution — large KTX2 atlases,
//! derived-cache RGBA sidecars, or preloaded model JSON).
//!
//! The returned [`Arc<MappedBytes>`] exposes a `Deref<Target = [u8]>`
//! so downstream decoders that take `&[u8]` slices work unchanged.
//! Cloning is a refcount bump — the mmap survives as long as any
//! clone is alive, and is torn down when the last reference drops.
//!
//! Not a silver bullet: mmap trades a synchronous heap copy for
//! on-demand page faults, so tight iteration over sparse bytes
//! inside a large mapping can be *slower* than a plain
//! `Vec<u8>::read`.  The intended use is "decode once, release":
//! image decoders walk every byte exactly once, and the OS page
//! cache supplies each page in the order the reader touches them.
//!
//! The module is callable from every target we build; Android
//! `memmap2` is supported there via the standard POSIX `mmap`
//! syscall.  Falls back to plain `read` on platforms where mmap is
//! unavailable (none currently, but kept behind `Result` so a
//! future restriction doesn't crash).

//! Key-value storage belongs to one game, not to the host app.
//!
//! This product is sold into game centres: one host app, a catalogue of
//! third-party titles, one after another in the same process. Storage was
//! anchored to the host app's files directory while code, cache and user data
//! were already per game, so every title in a catalogue shared one SQLite file.
//! Three consequences, all reachable through ordinary storage APIs:
//!
//! - one game could read another's saves by guessing keys;
//! - `migo.clearStorage()` -- a normal call for a game resetting itself --
//!   wiped the whole catalogue;
//! - the 10 MB quota was a shared pool a single game could exhaust.
//!
//! It also disagreed with the mini-game platforms this engine is compatible
//! with, where each game has its own 10 MB.
//!
//! These tests pin the isolation at the path level, where the bug was, rather
//! than by writing through the ops: the ops route through the IO scheduler and
//! a real SQLite file, which tests the scheduler and SQLite rather than the
//! question at hand.

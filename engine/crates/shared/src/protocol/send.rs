//! Handing a render command to the render thread, from the producer's side.
//!
//! Split out of `protocol/mod.rs` rather than left there because these are the
//! only items in the protocol module that take a [`CanvasOpState`]. That type
//! holds `VirtualFS`, `MountTable` and `GamePaths` handles, so every one of them
//! dragged the whole virtual filesystem -- and, through it, a C compression
//! library -- into anything that merely wanted to *name* a render command. The
//! engine-free decoder names them and sends none, which is why the boundary is
//! drawn here: a vocabulary must not require the transport that carries it.
//!
//! The classification and timeout policy stays in the parent module. It answers
//! questions about op names and needs no host state, and both sides use it.

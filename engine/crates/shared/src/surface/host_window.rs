//! The one window measurement a host publishes, and the one service that
//! reports it to content.
//!
//! Two implementations of this rule existed. The C ABI carried a seqlock so a
//! host could re-attach a resized surface and have `wx.getSystemInfoSync()`
//! follow it; the desktop platforms carried a construction-time snapshot that
//! could never be updated, with a comment saying so. Both serialised the same
//! `WindowInfo`, field for field, so the only real difference was that one
//! could change and the other could not — which is the shape of defect this
//! repository keeps finding rather than a design.
//!
//! Content works in CSS pixels, so `pixel_ratio` is what keeps physical and
//! logical apart. Reporting physical pixels as CSS pixels lays a game out at
//! the wrong scale while every pixel still lands exactly where the engine put
//! it, which is why it reads as a content bug rather than a host one.

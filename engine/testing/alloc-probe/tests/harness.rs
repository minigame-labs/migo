//! What the burst assertion can and cannot see, measured against a real allocator.

//! These live in an integration test rather than beside the code because the
//! property under test is a property of a *binary*: the assertion is only
//! meaningful where a counting `#[global_allocator]` is installed, and an
//! integration test is the smallest unit that can install one. The crate's own
//! unit tests are the opposite control — that binary installs no counting
//! allocator, so the self-check must refuse to certify anything there.

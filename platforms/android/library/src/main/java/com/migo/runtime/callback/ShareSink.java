 * The channel a {@link ShareHandler} settles {@code migo.shareAppMessage()} on.

 * and a dismissal cannot deliver two results to content.
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 * Every method is safe to call from any thread, which is what you need to show
 * a share sheet and answer on whatever thread its callback arrives on.
 *
 * <p>Calls for a session that has ended are ignored, so you do not have to race
 * teardown to stay correct.

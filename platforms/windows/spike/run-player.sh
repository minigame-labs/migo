# Build, link and RUN the headless player on the Windows MSVC toolchain, and
# bring its captured frame back for inspection.
#
# Usage: run-player.sh <windows-game-dir-dos> [seconds]
#
# This is the step past run-tests.sh. Passing tests prove the code executes;
# they do not prove the graphics stack can reach a GPU. On Windows that means
# ANGLE: EGL is not a system library there, so a context has to come from the
# ANGLE DLLs, and nothing about a unit test exercises that. The player renders a
# real game offscreen and reads the presented frame back as a PNG, which is the
# same evidence the Linux port used -- an image with content, not a green log.
#
# The ANGLE runtime DLLs must be on MIGO_WIN_EXTRA_PATH; they are loaded by name
# at run time, exactly as the engine loads them on a user's machine.
#
# VERIFYING INPUT reaches content: run with --window against
# tests/c_host/touch-probe (staged Windows-side). The probe paints the whole
# screen one colour and changes it only when input arrives, so the captured frame
# is the evidence: red = nothing ever arrived, green = a pointer is down, blue =
# a press and release both reached JS. Click in the window while it runs.
#
# Deliberately manual. An earlier version injected a click with PostMessage from
# PowerShell; it never located the window from this WSL-launched setup, and a
# harness that reports success without having clicked is worse than none -- it
# once made a human click look like an automated pass. Automation is worth
# re-adding, but only with the injector proving it actually clicked.

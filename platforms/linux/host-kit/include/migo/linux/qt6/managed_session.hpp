/// A Qt 6 Widgets container that owns one Migo Session.
///
/// This is the Managed half of the Host Kit's two ownership shapes. The Bound
/// half is `MigoQtX11SurfaceView` driven by an App-owned `SurfaceHost`: there
/// the App owns the Session, keeps it alive across views, and installs its own
/// callback table. Here the Host Kit owns the Session, its callbacks and its
/// view, and retires all three on request. The two are separate types rather
/// than one type with a flag, because the difference is who is responsible for
/// an asynchronous teardown -- a question a boolean cannot answer.
///
/// What this does NOT own is the `MigoEngine`: one App may run several Sessions
/// on one engine (preloading, multiple windows), and a wrapper that created its
/// own would make that impossible. The engine, the parent widget and the
/// QApplication must each outlive this object.
///
/// Teardown is the C ABI's three steps and cannot be shortened: begin the
/// detach, wait for the release observer to report RELEASED, then destroy the
/// Session. `close()` starts that and returns immediately; `sessionClosed`
/// arrives once the Session is really gone. Destroying this object while it is
/// still running is a programming error and terminates, for the same reason the
/// view does: silently dropping the only release handle leaves the host unable
/// to destroy its own window safely, and no later call can recover it.
///
/// The whole public API is confined to the GUI thread, which is the Session's
/// owner thread. Engine callbacks arrive on engine threads and are marshalled
/// here before any of them runs.

# The Android host API is frozen at v0: changing it must be deliberate.
#
# An embedder building against this SDK compiles against `com.migo.runtime` and
# ships that binding inside their app. A method that quietly changes shape costs
# them a release; one that disappears costs them a build. "We froze the host
# API" is a sentence that appears in licence conversations, and it is only true
# if something enforces it.
#
# The surface is read from the *compiled classes* with `javap`, not scraped from
# the sources. Source-scraping means inventing a rule for what looks public, and
# a rule like that is wrong in the direction that matters: it misses things, and
# what it misses is exactly what changes unnoticed. The classes are what an
# embedder links against, so they are what gets pinned.
#
# `internal` is excluded: it is the JNI plumbing, pinned separately and more
# strictly by `jni_profile_contract` since it must match on both sides of a
# native boundary.
#
# To change the surface on purpose:
#   bash scripts/test-android-host-api-contract.sh --update
# and commit the regenerated baseline with the change. Reviewing that diff is
# the point of the gate.

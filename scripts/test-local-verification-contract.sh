# three Android compile errors survived several sessions of green host runs.
#
#   * a crate source the module walk cannot reach stops the run, because an
#     unreached file has unknown platform conditions;
#   * a required target with no local build is reported NOT PROVEN and fails, never
#     skipped;
#   * the scope is what the flags say it is, so a narrow run cannot be read as a
#     broad one.
#
# The fixtures are throwaway repositories holding the real script and the real

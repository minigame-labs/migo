# The Performance+ product must contain no embedded JavaScript engine.
#
# This is the one claim the whole iOS fast lane rests on. Content JavaScript runs
# inside WebKit's WebContent process to get the system's JIT; the renderer runs
# here, in the app process, and it is allowed to be here *because* it is not a
# second JavaScript engine. An iOS build that quietly linked V8 would be
# shipping two engines, paying twice for working set and package size, and
# claiming a memory advantage it had just spent.
#
# THE DRIFT THIS EXISTS TO CATCH is not somebody adding V8 on purpose. It is a
# convenience dependency three levels down: `migo-capi -> migo-core ->
# migo-runtime-v8 -> deno_core` was the shape when this gate was written, and
# nothing about `migo-core`'s public surface says so. The dependency is a fact
# about the resolved graph, so only the resolved graph can answer it.
#
# It measures the SHIPPING PRODUCT, not a proxy. An earlier plan for this gate
# had it check a small probe crate that depended on the external-frame feature.
# A probe's closure being clean says nothing about the product's closure -- the
# question is what `migo-capi` resolves to when built the way the iOS product is
# built, and that is what is asked here.
#
# Host-only for the Cargo half. The archive half needs macOS tooling and runs
# when --artifact points at a built static library; it does not silently pass
# when it cannot run.

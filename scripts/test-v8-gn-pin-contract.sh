#
# Assert that the V8 build refuses a gn that is not the pinned one.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (observed, not hypothetical):
# gn generates the entire build graph, so it is an input to every byte of
# librusty_v8.a. The Android build script used to resolve gn from V8_GN_PATH, then
# a prefetched path, then the system PATH, and merely *log* whichever it found.
# The generated component manifest recorded rustc, the compiler, the SDK and the
# linker, and omitted gn entirely — so two archives built with different gn
# revisions were indistinguishable in their own provenance. The gn in use here was
# additionally built from source with a local one-line change that existed nowhere
# in the repository.
#
# WHY IT CHECKS WHAT IT CHECKS:
# `gn --version` prints `<version> (<short-revision>)`, and neither half is an
# identity. Both come from the same `git describe HEAD` at gn build time, with no
# dirty marker, so a gn built from the pinned commit *without* the required patch
# reports exactly the same string as the intended binary. Checking the revision
# looks like it closes that and does not. The version string is only a cheap first
# filter; what enforces the patch set is the receipt scripts/build-gn.sh writes
# beside the installed binary, naming the patches it applied and binding them to
# that binary's own hash. The local change is a committed patch, and the gn
# checkout is additionally proved to be HEAD plus exactly the declared patches, so
# the pin describes a gn that can be reproduced rather than one that merely happens
# to be on this machine.

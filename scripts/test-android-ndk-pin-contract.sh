# Assert that the Android build uses the NDK the lock pins, and finds it rather
# than guessing where it lives.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (observed, not hypothetical):
# Seven scripts independently defaulted ANDROID_NDK_HOME to `$HOME/Android/Ndk`.
# That path exists on none of the machines this project has been built on -- the
# NDK actually in use is at `$HOME/Android/Sdk/ndk/23.2.8568313` -- so every
# successful build silently depended on the variable already being set correctly in
# the environment, and a fresh checkout on a new machine would fail on a path
# nobody ever had. Nothing asserted *which* NDK it pointed at either, so the V8
# archive and the AAR could be produced by different NDKs with nothing noticing,
# even though the component manifest records the NDK revision, the target compiler,
# the sysroot and the linker as part of the artifact's identity.
#
# WHY IT CHECKS WHAT IT CHECKS:
# A directory name is not an identity: `$SDK/ndk/23.2.8568313` is just a name
# somebody could rename or populate with anything. The check therefore reads
# `Pkg.Revision` from the NDK's own `source.properties`, which is the same fact the
# component manifest stamps into the artifact. An explicit ANDROID_NDK_HOME is
# honoured but still checked, so an override cannot substitute a different
# toolchain silently.

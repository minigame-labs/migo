# Fetch prebuilt V8 archives for one or more targets and verify them.
# Location: scripts/fetch-v8-archives.sh
#
# These are build products of scripts/build-v8-{android,linux}.sh. They used to
# be tracked in Git LFS, which made every CI checkout spend LFS bandwidth on
# ~247 MB and eventually exhausted the repository's quota -- at which point
# checkout failed and nothing could build, for a reason that had nothing to do
# with the code. Release assets do not count against that quota, so the archives
# live on a release and are pulled here instead.
#
# Integrity does not depend on the transport. Each archive is checked against the
# `hashes.archive` sha256 in the committed component-manifest.json, which the
# release gate already treats as the authority on what a valid archive is. That
# is a stronger statement than LFS made: LFS guaranteed the bytes matched an
# object id, but nothing tied that object to the manifest.
#
# A target with no committed manifest cannot be fetched, by design: without one
# there is nothing to say what a valid archive is, and downloading bytes that
# cannot be checked would make this a plain transport wearing a verification
# comment.
#
# `aarch64-linux-ohos` was absent for that same reason and no longer is: it was
# built and sealed on 2026-08-10 (component_id 2a85cc63…), so it now has
# something to be verified against and is listed. Note what it means for the two
# modes, which differ here: `--check` verifies the local archive against its
# committed manifest and passes, while a *download* of this target has nowhere to
# come from until the archive is published as a release asset. That is a true
# report of the state rather than a gap -- the fetch fails naming the missing
# asset instead of the target being silently unknown.
#
# `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` is the same shape with one difference: the build
# yields a DLL plus its import library, not a single .a, so it is not
# `librusty_v8-<target>.a`. Only the primary link-time artifact (the import
# library, hashes.archive in the component manifest -- see
# write-windows-v8-component-manifest.py's comment on why the schema does not
# widen to cover the DLL) is hash-verified here; the DLL is fetched alongside it
# because a Windows build cannot link or ship without it, verified in turn when
# scripts/build-windows-sdk.sh stages it into the package manifest.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/fetch-v8-archives.sh [--check] [--all] [target...]
#   --check      verify what is already present; download nothing
#   --all        every target known to this script
#   target...    one or more of: aarch64-linux-android, x86_64-linux-android,
#                x86_64-linux-gnu, x86_64-linux-ohos, aarch64-linux-ohos,
#                x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
#
# With no target given, the two Android targets are fetched. That is what the
# Android build and CI need, and keeping it the default means adding a target
# here never silently makes those builds download more than they use.

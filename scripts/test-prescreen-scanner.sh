# The prescreen scanner must not under-report.

# `scripts/prescreen-game.sh` answers "which APIs does this bundle need, and
# does this build publish them". Its dangerous failure is silent under-reporting:
# a bundle reaches the namespace through an alias or a computed key, the scanner
# does not follow it, and the report comes back saying everything is supported.
# That is the one wrong answer that costs a customer, so the scanner's job is
# either to resolve an access or to say out loud that it could not.
#
# The fixture in `tools/api-surface/fixture/` exercises each access form once,
# against a checked-in synthetic surface rather than a live dump -- the scanner's
# logic is what is under test, and binding it to a player run would make this
# slow, machine-dependent, and prone to changing whenever the runtime does.

# becomes the script's. So the dumper exited 1 on every successful run in its
# default mode -- after printing `surface -> <path>` and a complete, correct
# surface -- and `set -e` in prescreen-game.sh turned that into a prescreen that
# produced no report and said nothing about why. The adapter path happened to
# set STAGE and return 0, so the runs anyone tried worked.

# the dumper: the dumper needs a built player, and a check nobody can run on a
# laptop is a check that stops being run.

# the function is written across several lines; against the one-line form it
# finds no closing line and swallows the rest of the file, so this check went red

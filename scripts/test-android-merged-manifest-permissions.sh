# The permission surface the AAR actually ships, read from Gradle's merged manifests.
#
# `test-permission-coverage-contract.sh` holds the *source* manifests to the policy,
# which is not the same claim: the manifest that reaches a consumer is the merged one,
# and a dependency, a `tools:` directive or an AGP change can add a `uses-permission`
# that no source manifest in this repository mentions. That gate also only checks that
# each policy entry is *present*, so a permission nobody declared on purpose passes it.
# Here the comparison is exact in both directions, per profile.
#
# The API levels are the consumer-visible consequence rather than an extra assertion:
# given an exact set with exact `maxSdkVersion` values, what an app requests on a given
# Android version is determined. They are asserted and printed because "which
# permissions does a Slim build ask for on Android 12" is the question a compliance
# reviewer actually has, and deriving it by hand from `maxSdkVersion` is where a
# reviewer makes a mistake.

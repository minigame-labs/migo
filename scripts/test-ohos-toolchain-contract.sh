#
# Assert that every C/C++ object in an OpenHarmony build was produced by the
# OpenHarmony SDK's own clang -- not by whatever compiler happened to be on
# PATH.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (observed 2026-07-30, not hypothetical):
# The first ohos build on this machine compiled zstd and sqlite3 with the
# Android NDK r23c's clang 12 and its bionic headers, for a musl target. It
# SUCCEEDED: cc-rs passes --target, so the object files carried the correct
# triple and the link went through. The damage is invisible until runtime,
# where bionic-shaped struct layouts meet musl ones. An ambient CC beats
# .cargo/config.toml's non-forcing [env] block, and skia-bindings does not even
# consult cc-rs's target prefixes -- it reads CLANGCC, then plain CC.
#
# WHY IT CHECKS WHAT IT CHECKS:
# The obvious probe -- readelf -p .comment on the objects -- is NOT usable.
# The OHOS clang emits no .comment section at all, so "no object says Android"
# is true both when the toolchain is correct and when the object carries no
# identity whatsoever. A guard whose green state is indistinguishable from its
# blind state is worse than none. Instead this reads the compiler path cc-rs
# itself recorded in each build script's `output` file: the build reports its
# own toolchain, and that report is what gets checked.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/test-ohos-toolchain-contract.sh [target-triple]
#     default target: x86_64-unknown-linux-ohos
#
# Env:
#   OHOS_SDK_NATIVE  the SDK's native/ directory. If unset, dev-setup-ohos.sh
#                    is consulted.

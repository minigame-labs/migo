# Assert that deduping `glScissor` never clips a draw the game wanted.
# Location: scripts/verify-scissor-dedup.sh
#
# `glScissor` went undeduped for a long time on a stated reason: the engine
# re-points the driver's scissor box behind the state shadow's back.
# `dirty_region::apply_scissor` borrows the box for every partial-damage
# Canvas2D batch, and the DrawingBuffer blit toggles the enable bit around a
# present. A shadow blind to either would report a hit for a call the driver
# needed, leaving every later draw clipped to a box the game never asked for —
# with no GL error and nothing in a log.
#
# The dedup landed once both engine paths were routed through the shadow:
# `ScissorBorrow` carries the pre-borrow state and writes `last_scissor_rect`
# from the same computation that feeds the driver, and the blit only touches the
# enable bit, restoring it from what it read.
#
# Unit tests pin the predicate (`state_tracker::scissor_*`) and the restore
# mapping (`dirty_region::the_reported_box_is_always_the_box_the_driver_holds`,
# including the arm where a disable leaves GL holding the engine's box). What
# they cannot pin is that a *stale* shadow stays impossible end to end, because
# that needs a driver. This does.
#
# The fixture re-asserts an identical scissor box — the exact call a dedup
# swallows — and then widens to the full surface and paints over everything. A
# driver still holding the narrower box leaves red behind, so the failure shows
# up as two colours rather than requiring the gate to know which one is wrong.

# What API surface does a mini-game bundle need, and does this build have it?
#
# The question a platform asks before migrating a catalogue is "how many of my
# games break". This answers the part that can be answered without running
# anything: which `wx.*` / `migo.*` names the bundle references, and which of
# those this build actually publishes.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT TELL YOU -- read before quoting it at a customer:
#
#   * A name being published is not a working call. `wx.login` exists on every
#     build; whether it succeeds depends on the host installing an auth handler.
#     This reports the surface, never the behaviour.
#   * Static analysis under-reports by nature. Bundles reach APIs in ways no
#     scanner can resolve -- computed keys, aliases through data structures,
#     `eval`. Those are reported in their own bucket rather than folded into
#     "supported", because a scanner that quietly under-reports produces a
#     confident "everything is supported" and that is the one wrong answer that
#     costs a customer.
#   * Migration also fails on things that are not API names at all: DOM/CSS
#     assumptions, WebGL2, subpackage layout, timing. Running the game is the
#     only way to see those, and it has to be run on Android -- the Linux player
#     has no device services, so it reports failures Android would not have.
#
# WHERE `wx` COMES FROM, AND WHY THIS SCRIPT ONCE DIED:
#
# The engine publishes no `wx` names at all -- that namespace is an adapter's
# job. migo-wx-adapter mirrors `migo.*` onto `wx` minus a small exclusion set,
# so the wx surface is real but it only exists once an adapter has been loaded.
# This script was deleted wholesale by the change that removed wx wording from
# the engine (#69), together with the conformance suite, even though its `wx`
# references are literal identifiers -- the thing that change said it would
# keep. Restoring it therefore also means fixing the assumption it was written
# under: it used to require the *engine* to publish `wx`, which is now never
# true, and would refuse to run at all.
#
# So: pass `--adapter FILE` (the adapter's IIFE bundle). The dumper injects it
# ahead of the surface probe, in the same isolate, exactly as a host does, and
# the `wx` names reported are the ones an adapter actually installed rather than
# the ones its source appears to assign. Without it, a bundle that references
# `wx.*` gets a report that says it cannot answer -- not a report that calls
# every wx name a gap.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/prescreen-game.sh <bundle-dir> [--adapter FILE]
#                                  [--surface FILE] [--out FILE]
#
#   --adapter FILE  adapter bundle to load before the probe, so `wx.*` can be
#                   answered at all
#   --surface FILE  reuse a dump from scripts/dump-api-surface.sh instead of
#                   producing one (the dump costs a player run)
#   --stubs FILE    reuse a list from scripts/dump-stub-surface.sh instead of
#                   deriving one (deriving is a source scan, not a player run)

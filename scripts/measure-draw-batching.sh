# Measure how much draw-call batching headroom a workload actually has.
# Location: scripts/measure-draw-batching.sh
#
# `GlBatch` executes its commands in order and merges nothing. Whether that
# costs anything had never been measured — and it is not answerable in the
# abstract, because merging is largely the application's job in WebGL: state can
# change between draws, and whether it does is up to the game.
#
# What makes it answerable is one counter. `adjacent_draws` counts draws issued
# with zero *post-dedup* state changes since the previous draw of the same frame:
# the upper bound on what a batching pass could merge. Post-dedup is the load
# bearing part — a state command the shadow swallowed never reached the driver,
# so draws separated only by those are adjacent as far as the GPU is concerned,
# and it is the GPU's view that decides whether a merge is possible.
#
# Two fixtures bracket the answer rather than guessing at a typical frame:
#
#   draw-batching-sprite    64 draws of the *same* range   -> adjacent, not mergeable
#   draw-batching-walk      64 draws walking one buffer     -> adjacent and mergeable
#   draw-batching-material  a state change before each draw -> neither
#
# The first two differ only in whether the ranges advance, and that is the point:
# adjacency says nothing reached the driver in between, mergeability says the two
# draws could become one *and paint the same pixels*. A workload can be 98% the
# first and 0% the second.
#
# A real game's ratio lands between them. Run it against the game catalogue to
# find out where; that is what the bracket is for.
#
# The counter is validated independently by
# `render_frame_state::adjacency::*` in migo-graphics, which replays
# hand-written draw/state interleavings and checks the score. This script is the
# end-to-end path, which also proves the counter is wired from the render thread
# through to the stats a host can read.
#
# Each fixture also paints flat rgba(51,204,102,255), so a run that stopped
# drawing is caught rather than reported as a superb ratio over zero draws.

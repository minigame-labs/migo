# The runtime must never be able to mint an ad reward.
#
# For incentivised video, `isEnded` on the `close` event is what content uses to
# decide whether to pay the player. It has to come from the host's ad SDK. If
# the runtime can produce a truthy `isEnded` on its own, the publisher hands out
# rewards for adverts nobody watched: they pay the reward and earn nothing. That
# was the state of this engine before the host-authoritative ad bridge landed --
# `01_ad.js` fired `close` with a hardcoded `{ isEnded: true }` on a timer.
#
# The regression is silent by nature. Every callback still fires, the flow still
# looks correct in a demo, and the damage only shows up in someone's revenue
# reconciliation weeks later. So it gets a source-level gate rather than relying
# on the behavioural tests alone (`tests/ad_reward_integrity.rs`), which can only
# cover the paths they were written for.
#
# The rule, applied to every embedded JS module:
#
#   `isEnded` may be assigned only `false`, or an expression that strict-compares
#   a host-supplied value to `true`. Anything else -- a `true` literal, a truthy
#   number, a string, a loose `!!` coercion -- is a violation.
#
# The gate also fails when its own anchors go missing, so deleting the sanitiser
# or the host event channel cannot turn it into a no-op.

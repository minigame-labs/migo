# Stage migo into the OpenHarmony host project and build the HAP.
#
# The host in platforms/openharmony is an ordinary DevEco project that consumes
# the C SDK: it sees only the public headers and links libmigo_capi.a into its
# own libmigohost.so. That is the same relationship the Android NativeActivity
# host has with the Android C SDK, and keeping it that way is what makes the
# host a test of the SDK rather than an extension of it.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build-ohos-host.sh [--arch x86_64|aarch64] [--no-hap]
#
# Env:
#   OHOS_NDK_HOME    OpenHarmony SDK (probed via dev-setup-ohos.sh)
#   DEVECO_HOME      DevEco Studio install (default: the standard Windows path
#                    reached through /mnt/c, since the emulator and hvigor live
#                    on the Windows side while the engine is built in WSL)

#
#   - hvigor rejects a UNC project path outright ("Invalid project path"), so
#     the project cannot be built in place on \\wsl.localhost. It is copied to a
#     real Windows directory first.
#   - cmd.exe refuses a UNC working directory and silently falls back to
#     C:\Windows, so every cmd invocation runs from a local directory.
#
# An earlier revision of this script printed advice to run hvigor by hand
# against the UNC path -- advice that cannot work -- and then exited 0, so it
# reported success while producing nothing. This does the build.

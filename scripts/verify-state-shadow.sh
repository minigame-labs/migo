# Assert that the GL state shadows dedup only what is actually redundant.
# Location: scripts/verify-state-shadow.sh
#
# The engine skips a driver call when its shadow says the state already matches.
# Three of those shadows were containers whose key space the spec fixes, and were
# re-shaped to match it: TEXTURE_2D bindings (hash map keyed by the
# `GL_TEXTURE0 + i` enum -> array indexed by `i`), `glEnable`/`glDisable` (two
# hash sets -> two bitmasks), and vertex-attribute pointers/enables/divisors
# (three containers keyed `(vao, index)` -> one record per VAO, attributes
# indexed directly).
#
# The unit tests pin the dedup predicates. What they cannot pin is that a wrong
# predicate stays invisible: a shadow that over-dedups skips a call the driver
# needed, and the result is wrong pixels with no GL error and nothing in a log.
# So the fixture gives each of the three a step whose outcome is the colour.
#
# Both failure modes were reproduced before this gate was written, by breaking
# the implementation and capturing the frame:
#
#   * `TextureUnitShadow::index` collapsed onto slot 0 -> rgba(0,0,0,255)
#   * `VertexArrayShadow::enable` collapsed onto bit 0 -> rgba(0,0,0,255)
#
# and the intact tree presents rgba(51,204,102,255) over 240 frames. Nothing else
# about those runs differed.
#
# Three assertions, because each alone is satisfiable by something other than the
# property: the frame count (a run that painted nothing leaves the previous
# frame), the colour (distinguishing all four outcomes the fixture can produce),
# and the distinct sampled colour count (a frame presented through a partial
# damage region carries wrong pixels in only part of the surface).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-state-shadow.sh [SECS]
#
# Requires the host player and its EGL/V8 environment; builds it every run.

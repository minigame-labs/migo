# ============================================================
# Assert that a re-linked program's uniform reaches the driver again.
# Location: scripts/verify-uniform-shadow.sh
#
# The engine dedups `glUniform*` per `(program, location)`. A uniform's value is
# state of the program object (GLES 3.0 §2.11.6), so `glUseProgram` cannot
# disturb it — but a successful `glLinkProgram` gives the program fresh uniform
# storage and initialises it, discarding everything the driver held. Leave the
# shadow in place across that and the content's next upload of an *unchanged*
# value is deduped against a driver holding zero: the uniform silently keeps its
# initial value and the draw paints with it. No GL error, no log line.
#
# Why this needs a presented frame rather than a unit test: the unit tests in
# `state_tracker.rs` assert the dedup *predicate*, which is the thing that was
# wrong — so they were all green while the defect was live. The verdict that
# cannot be satisfied by a wrong predicate is the pixel.
#
# Three assertions, because each alone is satisfiable by something other than
# the property:
#
#   * the frame count — a run that painted nothing leaves whatever the previous
#     frame was on the surface;
#   * the distinct sampled colour count — a frame presented through a partial
#     damage region carries wrong pixels in part of the surface while the stale
#     majority still reads as expected;
#   * the colour itself, distinguishing all four outcomes the fixture can
#     produce, so a failure says which one happened.
#
# Measured against the defect: with `state_tracker::invalidate_program_uniforms`
# stubbed to a no-op, this fixture presents rgba(0,0,0,0) over 180 frames. With
# the invalidation in place it presents rgba(51,204,102,255) over 180 frames.
# Nothing else about the run differs, which is what makes the gate a gate.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-uniform-shadow.sh [SECS]
#
# Requires the host player and its EGL/V8 environment; builds it every run.

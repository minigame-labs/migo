# Materialising a verified V8 archive under a content-addressed path, for the PowerShell
# entry points.
# Location: scripts/lib/V8Materialise.psm1
#
# The counterpart of scripts/lib/v8-materialise.sh, and it exists for the same reason
# AndroidNdk.psm1 does: the rule was enforced on the shell path only.
# `build-android-so.ps1` selected its archive with `Test-Path` -- existence, not identity --
# and `build-aar.ps1` invokes it, so once the PowerShell release path started working that
# was the shipping Windows-host route to an AAR linked against unverified bytes.
#
# The path names both hashes for the same reason the shell version does: cargo reruns the v8
# crate's build script when the *value* of RUSTY_V8_ARCHIVE changes, not when the file at
# that path is replaced, so content in the path is what makes its staleness rule correct.

.SYNOPSIS
Verifies a V8 archive and binding against the component manifest beside them, then returns
their paths under a directory named by both hashes.

.DESCRIPTION
A target with no committed manifest is refused rather than materialised: without one there is
nothing to say what the right bytes are, which is the rule scripts/fetch-v8-archives.sh
states for downloading them and scripts/lib/v8-materialise.sh states for using them.

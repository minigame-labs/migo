# Seven scripts independently defaulted ANDROID_NDK_HOME to `$HOME/Android/Ndk`, a
# path that exists on none of the machines this has been built on: every successful
# build depended on the variable already being set in the environment. Nothing
# asserted which NDK it pointed at either, so the V8 archive and the AAR could be
# produced by different NDKs with nothing noticing -- and the NDK is recorded in the
# component manifest as part of the artifact's identity.
#
# So the version is pinned in the build lock and the path is *found*, in the
# standard SDK layouts, rather than guessed. An explicit ANDROID_NDK_HOME still
# wins, because a caller may have the pinned NDK somewhere unusual -- but it is
# checked against the pin like any other candidate, so an override cannot silently
# substitute a different toolchain.

#
# Gates that read section sizes and dynamic entries out of a shipped .so must not
# take whatever `readelf` is on PATH. GNU binutils and LLVM do not print the same
# text for the same file -- GNU renders Android's DT tags as raw hex (`60000011`)
# where LLVM names them -- so a gate matching on that output reads a different
# answer on a machine with different tools installed, and reads it silently.
#
# Two size gates used to resolve their own: ANDROID_NDK_HOME if set, else the
# first llvm-readelf found anywhere under $HOME/Android, else PATH. Each of the
# three steps is a different toolchain, and the last is a different vendor.
#
# The search deliberately does not pass `-type f`. In NDK r23 `llvm-readelf` is a
# symlink to `llvm-readobj`, so `-type f` matches nothing, and that one flag is
# what sent both gates all the way down to `/usr/bin/readelf` on every machine
# that has an NDK -- the fallback chain never reported that it had been used.

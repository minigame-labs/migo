"""Proving a rusty_v8 checkout is its HEAD plus exactly the declared patches.

Location: scripts/lib/v8_source_proof.py

Shared by the per-platform V8 component manifest writers. Each platform keeps its
own writer, because each records a different toolchain and a different artifact
shape, and each decides its own policy about which paths may differ. What is shared
here is the *mechanics*: how to ask git about a checkout it may not own, how to read
what a patch claims to touch, and how to prove the worktree is the pristine sources
plus those patches and nothing else.

Why a proof rather than a list of allowed paths: the Android writer used to compare
modified paths against a hardcoded set. That set is a restatement of which files the
patches touch, so it drifts the moment a patch grows a file, and it cannot see an
edit *inside* an allowed file at all. Replaying the patches onto the pristine blobs
and comparing byte for byte answers the actual question.

Bytes are not sufficient on their own: a patch can carry `old mode`/`new mode`, so
the executable bit is compared too. The pristine content comes from `git cat-file`
with the mode from `git ls-tree`, never from `git show` into a file, because that
writes through the umask and loses the recorded mode.

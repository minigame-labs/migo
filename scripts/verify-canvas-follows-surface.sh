# Assert that the size of the onscreen canvas answers to one rule.
# Location: scripts/verify-canvas-follows-surface.sh
#
# The rule: a backing store the content never sized is the engine's, derived from
# the surface, and has to be re-derived when the surface changes; a size the
# content chose with `canvas.width` is the content's and must never move. Three
# installs have to agree about it -- a fresh create, a resize of the same native
# surface, and a destroy-and-recreate -- and the third one disagreed: it kept the
# preserved DrawingBuffer at the size derived from the surface the app was
# suspended on, so a canvas nobody sized came back from a rotation still
# describing a portrait window while `getSystemInfoSync()` reported the real one.
#
# An offscreen resize is the destroy-and-recreate path: a pbuffer of the new size
# *is* a new native surface, so it always takes the preserved-buffer branch. That
# makes this reachable with no device and no window server -- which is what the
# defect's own note said was impossible, having read "its trigger is Android
# rotation" as "only Android can show it".
#
# Two fixtures, because either half alone is satisfiable by the wrong engine:
#
#   * canvas-follow-probe never sizes its canvas and paints its verdict, so it
#     catches a backing store that did not follow;
#   * canvas-owned-probe fixes its own resolution and fills that, so a backing
#     store the engine moved anyway leaves part of the surface unpainted. It
#     cannot ask the question in JS -- `canvas.width` is the number JS holds --
#     so geometry asks it instead.
#
# Both paint grey until the window has actually changed extent: green is also
# what a correct pre-resize frame would be, so without that an engine that
# presented once and stopped would pass forever. The player refusing a capture
# that is not the resized extent is the second half of the same liveness reading.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-canvas-follows-surface.sh [SECS]
#
# Requires the host player and its EGL/V8 environment; builds it every run.

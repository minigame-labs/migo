# Every rustflag `.cargo/config.toml` declares for an Android target must survive
# into the AAR build.
#
# Cargo does not merge: setting `RUSTFLAGS` in the environment *replaces*
# `[target.<triple>].rustflags` rather than adding to it. `build-android-so.sh`
# has to set `RUSTFLAGS` -- the clang builtins directory is only known at build
# time -- so for as long as it did that blindly, the config's flags were dropped
# on the one build that ships. They kept applying to `build-android-sdk.sh` and
# `build-android-c-host.sh`, which set no `RUSTFLAGS`, so the config looked
# alive and the divergence was invisible.
#
# What it cost, measured on 2026-08-23 for arm64-v8a release: `libmigo.so`
# 45,709,280 -> 42,072,032 bytes once the flags were carried through. 3.47 MiB,
# 8% of the binary, nearly all `.text` (31.30 -> 27.88 MB) from `--gc-sections`
# and `--icf=all` never having run. Not a performance trade either -- startup
# was A/B'd interleaved and thermally gated, and first frame and game-ready both
# came out slightly better with the smaller image, at identical 59.8 fps.
#
# The failure had already left its fingerprint: `--allow-multiple-definition`
# appeared in *both* the config and the script. That is what someone does after
# finding the config's copy did not apply -- fix the flag in front of them and
# not the mechanism, leaving the other twelve dead.
#
# This gate reads what the build script would export and asserts every declared
# flag is in it. It does not build anything.

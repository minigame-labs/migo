# Build the OpenHarmony librusty_v8.a that migo's OHOS target links against.
# Location: scripts/build-v8-ohos.sh
#
# Counterpart to scripts/build-v8-{android,linux,windows}.sh. It is the most
# involved of the four, because upstream Chromium has no OpenHarmony support at
# all: `target_os` is not in any whitelist and neither build/ nor buildtools/
# mentions it. Every decision below was forced by a build that failed without
# it; the progression is recorded so nobody re-derives it.
#
#   attempt 1  ninja  37/2358  SDK clang 15 rejects `-std=c++23` (only knows
#                              the draft spelling `c++2b`) and three warning
#                              flags Chromium passes unconditionally. This is a
#                              compiler-version wall: both the 5.1.0 and the
#                              6.1 SDK ship clang 15.0.4, so no SDK bump fixes
#                              it. => V8 must be built with Chromium's clang.
#   attempt 2  ninja  56/2352  Chromium's clang, but its vendored libc++ has no
#                              musl branch: `__locale` reports "unknown rune
#                              table for this platform".
#   attempt 3  ninja 638/2284  Switched to the SDK's libc++ (which is built for
#                              musl) -- but it is libc++ 15 and V8 145's cppgc
#                              needs <source_location>, added in libc++ 16.
#   attempt 4  ninja 811/2317  Back to Chromium's libc++ with the portable rune
#                              table the error message itself names. Remaining
#                              failures were only -Werror on code unused in
#                              this platform combination.
#   attempt 5                  treat_warnings_as_errors=false, as build.rs
#                              already does for Android aarch64.
#
# Two libc++ copies end up in the product: V8 keeps Chromium's, Skia uses the
# SDK's. That is the arrangement Android already ships -- both are static
# libraries that never exchange C++ standard library objects across the
# boundary, and the public surface is a C ABI.
